The counterfeit "Made in Italy" market is a growing issue, causing significant economic and reputational damage to authentic Italian brands. The lack of reliable and decentralized supply chain traceability solutions has allowed counterfeit goods to proliferate. NapulETH, in partnership with the University of Federico II and Confindustria, is developing a blockchain-based digital twin solution leveraging Ethereum, Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZK), and IoT integrations to ensure full transparency and authenticity in the agrifood sector. This initiative aims to create an immutable, verifiable, and privacy-preserving system to certify product origin and quality.
